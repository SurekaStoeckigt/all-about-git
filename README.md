# A quick guide to the Git Workflow

Your job is to build out the scaffolded linked documents. Each one refers to a different part of the Git workflow.

Each scaffold should be completed with:

- An explanation of the step in the workflow (e.g. what does 'Fetching' mean, and why do we do it?);
- A guide to running this from the command line (e.g. `git fetch ...`), and
- Any advanced techniques to be used at this stage, e.g. flagging (for example, why the `-b` in `git checkout -b <branch name>`?)
- No ball games allowed
